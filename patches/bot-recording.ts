/**
 * RecordingSink adapter (2b) — the recording.v1 finalize + upload path, behind the
 * orchestrator's RecordingSink port (`close(key)`).
 *
 * recording.v1 has TWO halves (both in @vexa/recording): ACQUIRE (the browser MediaRecorder
 * tap → chunks) and DELIVER (chunk-upload over HTTP to meeting-api). The ACQUIRE side is
 * browser-resident and L4-gated (it lives in capture-bridge.ts); THIS file is the DELIVER +
 * finalize core:
 *   - chunk(seq, isFinal, format, bytes) accumulates recording.v1 chunks (createRecordingAssembler);
 *   - the empty is_final chunk OR close(key) triggers buildRecordingMaster → onMaster;
 *   - onMaster uploads the assembled master to inv.recordingUploadUrl via RecordingService.
 *
 * The orchestrator only ever calls close(key) (graceful teardown) — the robust assembly trigger,
 * since the live Stop race routinely loses the trailing MediaRecorder chunk (the WS closes before
 * it flushes). is_final is the prompt-path optimization. (See @vexa/recording's assembler doc.)
 *
 * The assembler itself is PURE (in-memory, callback-only) → L2/L3-testable without disk/socket
 * (recording.test.ts). The upload leg is L4-gated (needs a live meeting-api receiver).
